Question 1: What did you get when running f with the input above?
[13,12,11,10,9,8]

Question 2: What does this function f do?
It recursively adds 3 to a list.

Question 3: What does [10, 9..5] do? 
Creates a the list [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5].

Question 4: Given a comment that explains the line following (a).
If the parameter list is null

Question 5: Given a comment that explains the line following (b).
Return an empty list

Question 6: Given a comment that explains the line following (c).
Else add k to the element at the head of the list and call function recursivly with the tail of the list. Eventually this will return a list with every element added by k.

• Question 7: Name something you liked about Haskell. Explain. I like all the recursion, kind of fun and always good to practice. =)

• Question 8: Name something you dislike about Haskell. Explain. The strong typing is a bit annoying although once you get past the initial frustration it is not a big deal. 

• Question 9: How many hours did you spend on this lab? ~10 hours

• Question 10: Did you enjoy this lab? Yes. I like the short simple functions that build upon each other, a great way to learn a new language. 

• Question 11: Do you think you will use Haskell again? I sure hope so!
